    <h3>SURVEILLANCE</h3>
    <p class="surveillance">Whilst surveillance drones are used in a variety of ways to assist people or institutions such as the police,in the fight against crime, many issues<br>
      are raised over the legal and privacy issues which surround them. Firstly it has to be said that as drones carry highly advanced<br> cameras capable of recording 
      vast areas,meaning at some point, civllians will unwillignly be recorded. If you were to ask the majority<br> of people if they would want to be recorded, the majority 
      of people would probably would say no,even though many such as the police would say that it is nessecary in order to arrest or track indiviudals.From this they present a
      good response.<br> <br>Many drones as well are fitted and capable of intercepting your phone calls and texts. Even though you may not be doing anything illegal,
	  the fact they're able to take things <br>this poses a variety of questions, if they're able to intercept your calls. who is to say that another drone could intercept 
	  that drone and steal that information, as it could contain infromation such as passwords or bank details.One way in which this is been adressed can be seen in America
	  through a drone census,as this allows the public to ask what type of surveillance, agencies plan to use with drones and what of protection is in place.
