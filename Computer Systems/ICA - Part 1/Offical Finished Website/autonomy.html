<h1>AUTONOMY</h1>
<p class = "amazon">
One of the largest problems with autonomy in general, not just driverless cars, is the fact that jobs 
will be filled by machines instead of humans and a shift happens where people are the caretakers of 
these machines instead of the operators.
<br><br>
With driverless cars this problem is multi-faceted:
Safety concerns, if the car is fully autonomous does this mean that someone should be allowed and possibly
even encouraged to do other things on their journey or should they still have to be mindful of what is 
occurring during?
<br><br>
Decimation of entire job markets, once driverless vehicles become the norm; transportation will be 
completely changed and there’ll be no need for taxis/ trains/ coaches anymore as the driver becomes 
completely defunct.
<br><br>
Changing how we travel entirely, possibly the largest change of all is how the individual will travel. 
It is proposed that in 20 years’ time people won’t need to learn to drive, but is this taking away their 
freedom – as surely the data from their journeys will be recorded and will people even have their own 
vehicles or will a company essentially have control of their travel?
