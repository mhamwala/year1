<h1>Robot Ethics</h1>


<p class="left"><b>Narrow AI and General AI </b><br> <br> They are two different types of Artificial Intelligence, Narrow AI/ Weak AI and General AI/Strong AI. AI today is known as Narrow AI, narrow AI only perform specific tasks such as only Facial recognition or only an internet search or only driving a car.  In the long term researchers are aiming to create a Strong AI which will outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task. <br> <br> <b> Ethical Issues </b> <br> <br>
Robot ethics, sometimes referred to as Roboethics emphasizes ethical problems that may occur with robots in the long-run and in the short run.
Many areas of robotics are impacted , especially those where robots interact with humans. From elderly care , medical robots, robots used for entertainment  to robots used for various search and rescue missions including military robots.
<br> <br>
AI can be beneficial in many areas such as medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, remote sensing, scientific discovery and many more
A noted philosopher Nick Bostrom stated that "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore," which is true because thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded into the infrastructure of industry everyday and we donâ€™t really think about these applications or algorithms as AI technology.
<br><br>
There are some who believe that Strong AI will never be achieved and there are some who think that superintelligent Ai is guaranteed to be beneficial is us humans. The FLI (Future of Life Institute) examines both possibilities and the fact that AI systems could intentionally or unintentionally cause great harm. When considering how AI systems can be dangerous, researchers look at two possibilities which are that AI is programmed to do something devastating or that AI is programmed to do something beneficial but it's develops a destructive method for achieved its goal.
