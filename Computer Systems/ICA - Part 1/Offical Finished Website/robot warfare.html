<h1>Robots and Warfare</h1>
<p class="left">
<br> <br>
technology has changed warfare loads in the past 50 years through the creation of drones, submarines, rockets, jets and nuclear weapons. There is still a lot more new technologies in development as well such as exoskeletons, robots, guided bullets, darpa lenses and advancements in night vision technologies. 
<br> <br>
With all these new technologies in warfare coming along a lot of people question will we be using robots in wars soon, is it right to use robots and what effect they will have on warfare. There are ways this could go, it could reach the point where the robots take over the world such as skynet from terminator or we could simply reach the point where we posses such power we no longer have a need for war and everyone joins together.
<br> <br>
Either way none of that has happened yet and we still have to deal with all of these ethical issues today, there are many human rights groups which are appealing to ban robots and technology in warfare as how could you possibly programme a robot to decide whose life is worth taking or sparing. There is also the issue that should anybody have so much power over others.
