<h1>Alan Turing - The Turing Test</h1>
<div class="left">
<p style="margin-left:50px;">The turing test was developed by Alan Turing (an English Mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of Computer Science) in 1950. The test measures a machine's ability to display intelligent behaviour identical or equivalent to that of a human. Thus a human should not be able to tell the difference the machine and a human being by 
comparing the questions asked to both. Turing suggested that after 5 minutes of conversation if the human was convinced 70% of the time the machine is said to have passed the test. Additionally the test does not check the machine's ability to get correct answers, just the ability to answer questions that closely resemble answers humans would give. <br>
<br>
The Turing Test was an adaptation of a victorian-style competition called the Imitation Game. The Imitation Game is a game where by an interrogator asks questions to a man and a woman (A and B) in a separate room who reply with typewritten notes. The aim of the game is for the interrogator to determine which is the man and which is the woman.

<p class="left" style="margin-top:125px;">The Turing test takes the idea of the Imitation Game and replaces one of the characters (A or B) and replaces them with a computer program that is designed to deceive the questioner about its true identity. </p>
