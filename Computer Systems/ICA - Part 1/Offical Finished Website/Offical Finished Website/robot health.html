    <h1>Robots and Health Care</h1>
    <p class="left">
      Healthcare has risen loads in the past 100 years from using simple bandages and plasters to complex operation and procedures. It has risen so much that the average life span has gone from 45 in 1900 to 75-80 now in 2017. The biggest factor for all this was the technology we use now in modern health care.
      <br><br>
      There is a wide range of robots in the workplace these days. One of the bigger known and more useful ones would be a surgery precision robot known as daVinci. The surgeon is in control of the robot but uses it as a tool to increase his reach, flexibility
      and precision. Thanks to this surgery can be done a lot quicker and with better
      success rates.
      <br><br>
      Robots can help not just in the hospital but at home where it could take on many task a care taker would do. For example check their living conditions, book appointments, call the doctor or simply fetch things the patient couldn't get.
      <br><br>
      There is a big assistance by robots in the rehabilitation field as well, not just the machine that monitor vitals but through exoskeletons. These can help paralysed patients walk again and slowly get them back on their feet without the assistance of aid eventually. Currently thought these are expensive so are quite limited but they will become quite popular in the future.
