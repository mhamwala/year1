      Even currently cyber security is a major issue and even without cars being “fully” automated it has been shown that it is possible to gain control of cars wirelessly. 
      <br><br>
      Researchers at MIT found that they were able to do this in 2011.

      <br><br>
      Some cars which are connected to the internet in order to turn on the engine, track the vehicle or just simply to control 
      the radio are vulnerable to attack. People achieve this by manipulating the sensors and giving them false information 
      to make the car believe that it should brake, or steer. 
      <br><br>
      Even when a human is in control of this it could be problematic, but with an entire fleet of automated and interconnected cars this becomes even more of an issue.
