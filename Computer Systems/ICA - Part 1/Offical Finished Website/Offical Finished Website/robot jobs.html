    <h1>Robots and Jobs</h1>
    <p = class="left">
      Robots have now been around since the early 20th century and there has always been a big debate on how they will affect job growth or job decline. We all know the advantages robots could bring such as they don't need rest and they can do jobs which humans would not consider but will this leave the majority of us jobless.<br><br> 
      There are several articles which take different paths with this subject. The most popular theory is states that whilst robots are taking over simple jobs like flipping burgers or construction they are also creating many more jobs in other sectors currently. Obviously this is only up to a certain point in time where robot technology reaches the point that it could do any job but that wouldnâ€™t be in the next generation. Some articles state robots will take over most jobs within the next 30 years and with that said there are a lot of people questions what will humans do with all that leisure time or how are humans meant to find purpose without having a job or career.

      <b>My personal theory: </b> 
      <br><br>
      In the world there are already factories mainly ran by robots such as amazon prime's drone delivery or car construction businesses but you are also going to need people to maintain and fix these robots if there are issues so i believe that whilst robots are taking over jobs there will be other jobs created in areas such as computer science, programming and the engineering sector.
