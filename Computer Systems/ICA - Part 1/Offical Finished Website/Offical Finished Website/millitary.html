    <h3>Millitary</h3>
    <p class="millitary">Drones have been used since WW2, but it wasn't until 1995 that drones changed the course of millitary warfare.
      This was due to the introduction of the Gnat,later to be renamed the "Predator".<br>This introduced video 
      cameras for the first time  and it allowed drone operators 60 miles of panorama video,allowing them to see 
      and experience the battlefield in a completly new way.<br> This new type of warfare has changed the way many soldiers 
      view and experience war, as they become insulated from the risks of combat.<br> <br>
      Whilst many see the benefits of this type of warfare ,many have reservations about it with many soliders echoing the same
      thing in that they feel replaced and that their "professional pride<br> is under threat." This is due to the fact that as these bases 
      are mainly situated in the US, it means that they can go to work and go home on the same day, a benefit that any solider<br> would take 
      as it means that they would have to do long tours in places such as Afghanistan.
      One aspect of drone warfare which can't be taken lightly is that there is only a fifteen second delay between launch and landing 
      and a further three seconds to divert it,should a situation arise.<br> <br>One of these situations could be a child coming in to view og a high 
      value target in a populated place. This leads to many people dubbing this playing god, as you possess the power<br> to fire misslies at the touch
      of a button, which is why its impportant that you have correctly anaysled the situation as a three second diversion isnt enough when it could
      potenially kill tens,<br>or hundreds of people.In 2011 the US Airforce conducted a study and found that one in five drone pilots felt burnout as they were required to do twelve hour
      shifts,six days a week,leading <br>many to question the efectiveness and long term implications of drone warefare.
