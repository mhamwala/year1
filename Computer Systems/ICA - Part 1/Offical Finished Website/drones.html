  <h1>DRONES</h1>
  <h4>AMAZON </h4>
  <p class ="amazon" >Amazon is one  of the first companies to start testing drones for commercial use.<br>
    In the U.S.A,in order for it to start testing it had to comply with the CAA and was able to explore
    three areas,<br>
    1:operations beyond line of sight<br>
    2:obstacle avoidance<br>
    3:flights where one person operates multiple automonous drones<br> <br>
    This has allowed amazon to fully research these areas in order to 
    see how much research is necesarry and if it is feasble.
    One area which is stil a big hurdle  is that uk legislation requires
    drones to have 500m line of sight,whether they will be able to overcome this 
    is another area but in time this maybe reduced if the benefits outweight the 
    negatives.
    Pilots as well need training and then apply to the CAA  so that they can fly 
    drones for commerical uses.
    Amazon's delivery drones aim to deliver parcels within 30 minutes
    This provides a whole host of benefits including <br> <br>
    1:There will be less traffic on the roads, meaning energy effeicency
    will be improved, as once an order has been placed it can simplpy be
    delivered from the wherehouse which then leads on to another benefit<br>
    2:As it doesnt need to sent anywhere delivery times will be vastly reduced
    meaning customers can have parcels whenever they want, and it saves the company money to.

  <h4>Just Eat </h4>
  <p class ="just" >This is another example of where drones are really useful.<br>
    except here you would use a combination of both drones and people<br>
    as it would mean that you could serve more customers  as it would provide 
    additional support.It would save money as it would mean that 
    the company wouldnt need to hire additional staff when a robot could do it for free.

  <h4 class ="h4">Commercial Drones </h4>
  <p class ="drones">This has been a concept for many years, but it has now become reality.Starting in July<br>
    Dubai will starting allowing drones to carry one person to their desired destination.<br>
    It can travel up to 31 miles and take anything up to 100kg with a top speed of 63mph.Once this is fully implemented, this then could
	go to other cities,which will result in many compnaies such as taxi and car hire firms facing stiff competition.
